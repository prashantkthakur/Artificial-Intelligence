    "The negamax is an algorithm implemented to search for the move that would lead to a win. It is implemented in zero sum game where all the utility value (for the win and loose) sums up to zero. In the tic-tac-toe we assume the loss as -1, draw as 0 and win as 1 which basically is a zero-sum game so we can implement negamax to it. If the game is not a zero-sum game then we might have to consider the min-max algorithm. This function takes the depth and tries to search for the best move for the player which optimize the chance of his/her winning. Every call of this function returns the value which is negated (because the next recursion will be the opponent turn who would try to maximize the value in his turn) and then the function is recursively called untill the depth is exhusted or the best move for the player is found.

    "The negamaxIDS calls the negamax module recursively till the given depth. The `depthLeft+1` is used so that the depth is reached. For instance: if depthLimit was set to 9 then the search should proceed to 9th level and not terminate on 8th level. Additionally, a method `getWinningValue()` was implemented to generalize the game. It simply returns the utility value assigned for the win. For this instance of tic-tac-toe the win state has been assigned `1` and this tells that if the move has the utility value of 1 that means it is a winning move. Whenever a winning move has been found the current score and move is returned. Similarly, if there is no winning moves then the best move that has been found so far is stored in `bestValue` and `bestMove`. If the depth is exhusted and the winning move is not found then the best move and corresponding value is returned by this function."

    "This module uses most of the fundamental functionality of negamax function defined above. The function takes the alpha-beta pruning into consideration which simply means the player is only going to consider those moves which would lead to a win else it would simply skip exploring those moves in the game tree. The initial alpha is set to -infinity because we want to get the maximum possible value to get to a win, on the other hand the beta value is set to infinity so that we can keep track of the value we are trying to beat. The value of alpha and beta gradually changes based on the move in the program. The recursive call for the function is the opponent tern so we have to swap the values of alpha and beta and negate them as the opponent would try to sort its chances of winning by maximizing its moves. The bestValue is keept ini track to make sure the search returns the possible moves if it's not a win. However, if the best move is found which means the value of bestValue calculated for the move is greater than the beta then we are sure that the step that the opponent took can be turned into a win with the move with the bestValue >= beta."
