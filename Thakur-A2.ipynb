    "The functions depthLimitedSearch is implemented which takes five arguments. Initially the startState is matched to the goalState to ensure if the result has been achieved. The function provided for the assignment were not modified much. The only modification was to append the states that the search transverses to achieve the path. The depthLimitedSearch returns the empty path when the startState and goalState matches to remove duplicates in the search path when we do a iterative deepening search. If there are multiple solution to a state, the depth limited search tends to find the one that it encounters which is not necessarily the optimal path as it explores the deepest location of one child and then moves to another. Because of which if it find a solution path at level-2 (say) it won't bother to check if there exists a solution at level-1 at another node. This has been clarified at the bottom of the notebook with an explanation. So, depth limited search helps to remove the infinite loop problem thought it is not the best method to used based on the nature of the graph.\n",

This approach is done to make change to this function to create facilitate different length puzzle. Like- if we need to have 4X4 puzzle then all we need to do is switch the parameters in this function to generate 4X4 2-d array and 16 element in 1-d array. The parameter it takes is state and list boolean. By default the list boolean is fixed to False so that the state passed is changed from 1-d to 2-d array. When we have to return the result state, the 2-d array is converted to 1-d and for that particular conversion list=True is used. For instance, the function \"takeActionF_8p\" initially computes the 2-d array by passing only state (1-d array) however at the end of the computation, it returns 1-d array and the conversion from 2-d array is done using \"generaateNpArray\" function by passing list=True as second parameter.\n",

So for a given state [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], it is first converted into 2-d array and then the index is computed and the value is returned which in this case is (0, 1).\n",

    "# Description of DLS and IDLS behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that when we do an iterative deepening search with a start state [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8] to achieve a goal state [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8], we reach the goal state with an optimal solution. But this is not true for the depth limited search. The DLS seems to find the longest path based on the depthlimite passed to it. In the above example, the depth limit was passed to be 3 so the DLS tries to find all the child to the leftmost node and try to find if it gets to a solution. Since, the action are strictly arranged as [\"left\",\"right\",\"up\",\"down\"] the DLS first goes through all the leftmost child and finally gets a solution at the third level with different path. In order to clarify on this theme, lets change the depth limit to the function. For instance, we change the depth limit to 3 and the response we get is [[0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8],[1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8]].  Again with the same startState and goalState with depth limit of 5, we get a different path as a solution.  [[0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8],[1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], [0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8], [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 6, 7, 8]].\n",
    "\n",
    "This clearly indicates that the depth limited search is trying to find the deepest goal state which could be found at the leftmost part of the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the iterative deepening search tries to find the optimal solution because we gradually increase the depth of the graph and see if we can achieve the goal state at the given depth level. Since, there exists a path at level 1 which is matched first regardless of some higher maximum depth allowed. Because of this nature, every node at a given level is checked first and then the lower nodes are explored. Therefore, it finds the optimal path to a given goal state where depth limited search couldn't reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the similar result with the DLS, we have to try to use the minimum depth limit. For the above example if we set the depth limit to 2, then we get the same path as found by iterative deepening search. Hence, iterative deepening search is better over depth limited search. "

    "### Summary of Example\n",
    "There are 2 jugs which are 4-gallon and 3-gallon with no mesurement marking on them. You can fill as much water as you can and pour the water to empty the vessel as per your requirement. The ultimate goal is to find the path such that 4-gallon jug have exactly 2 gallon of water in it at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functional representation of the function is provided below. The function \"action_waterjug\" does the necessary calculation to find the next states that are possible from a given state. The function \"takeAction_waterjug\" returns the action that it receives. So there is not much that it does but to make the test case consistent with the IDLS function. The \"action_waterjug\" takes the state as input and tries to find all the states that could be possible for the case. The state are represented as (x,y) in tuple where x denotes the amount of water in 4-gallon jug and y denotes the amount of water in 3-gallon jug. So the valid input would be constructed with x<=4 and y<=3 with no fractional values, however, the IDLS would try to find the solution for the given state and match it to the goal state. In order to describe the task done in the function \"action_waterjug\", I would give an example how the states are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose the initial state is (4,0) so either 4-gallon jug remains filled and 3-gallon jug can be filled up to produce(4,3) or both jugs could be emptied to produce (0,0) or 3-gallon jug can be filled with the water from 4-gallon jug to give (1,3). So the child state of (4,0) could be (4,3),(0,0),(1,3).\n",
